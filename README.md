**MythBusting CrewAI** is a multi-agent AI workflow built with [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI)         that researches, writes, and optionally illustrates myth-busting articles about historical figures. It combines         large language models, retrieval tools (Wikipedia, WolframAlpha, arXiv, OpenLibrary), and optional image generation       (DALL·E) to produce high-quality Substack-ready content.
