# 👋 Hi, I'm Sarika!

I build tools that rethink truth in the age of AI — combining data, narrative, and code.

## 🧠 Current Projects
# 🕵️‍♀️ [MythBusting CrewAI](https://github.com/sarikasea/Mythbusters)

**MythBusting CrewAI** is a multi-agent AI workflow built with [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) that researches, writes, and optionally illustrates myth-busting articles about historical figures. It combines large language models, retrieval tools (Wikipedia, WolframAlpha, arXiv, OpenLibrary), and optional image generation (DALL·E) to produce high-quality Substack-ready content.
